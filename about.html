    <p>Everything from decorating your room to filling the fridge, shopping for clothing, gift to bring home, hangover kits, and more!

        Imagine arriving at your airbnb and being greeted by a fully furnished room without having to do a thing!</p>

        <p>
        It will not be as stressful as arranging a single woman party, particularly in the event planning that you are going to a city you have never been too. 
        That can be a difficult situation with next to no assistance.
